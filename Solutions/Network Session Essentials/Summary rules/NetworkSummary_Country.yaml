  'This summary rule aggregates recent network session data using the ASIM normalized _Im_NetworkSession function. It creates 20-minute summaries of traffic between source and destination countries, grouped by network direction and device action, covering only the last 20 minutes. It helps identify short-term geographic traffic patterns and potential anomalies in real time.'
