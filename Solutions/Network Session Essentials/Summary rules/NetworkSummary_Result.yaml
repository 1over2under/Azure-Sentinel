description: |
  'This summary rule aggregates recent network session data using the ASIM normalized _Im_NetworkSession function. It creates 20-minute summaries grouped by event result, network direction, device action, and event severity. This supports real-time monitoring of network outcomes and helps detect patterns in blocked, failed, or high-severity traffic.'
