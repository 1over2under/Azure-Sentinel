  'This summary rule aggregates recent network session data using the ASIM normalized _Im_NetworkSession function. It generates 20-minute summaries of traffic grouped by network protocol, destination port, destination application, network direction, and device action. This helps monitor application-level and port-based traffic behavior in near real time.'
