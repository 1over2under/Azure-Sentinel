Configuration Steps:\n\n1. Download the CloudFormation templates provided below:\n   - [OIDCWebIdProvider.json](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/c1344c7c13a718f771f444a54e51a3962a6dbbbd/DataConnectors/AWS-S3/CloudFormation/OIDCWebIdProvider.json): Template to configure the OIDC Web Identity Provider.\n   - [AWSRoute53ResolverLogs_CloudFormation.json](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/c1344c7c13a718f771f444a54e51a3962a6dbbbd/DataConnectors/AWS-S3/CloudFormation/DNSRoute53/AWSRoute53ResolverLogs_CloudFormation.json): Template to deploy Route53 resources and configurations.\n2. Go to the [AWS CloudFormation Stacks](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home) page. Make sure to select the right AWS region where you want all resources to be created.\n3. Create a new Stack for each template:\n   - First, create Stack using the `OIDCWebIdProvider.json` template:\n     1. Click on \"Create Stack\".\n     2. Choose the \"With new resources (standard)\" option.\n     3. Click on \"Choose an existing template\", \"Upload a template file\" and select the `OIDCWebIdProvider.json` file.\n     4. Click \"Next\" and follow the prompts to create the Stack.\n   - Next, create another Stack using the `AWSRoute53ResolverLogs_CloudFormation.json` template:\n     1. Click on \"Create Stack\".\n     2. Choose the \"With new resources (standard)\" option.\n     3. Click on \"Choose an existing template\", \"Upload a template file\" and select the `AWSRoute53ResolverLogs_CloudFormation.json` file.\n     4. Click \"Next\" and follow the prompts to create the Stack.\n     5. After the Stack is successfully deployed, note down the 'Value' for the following 'Key's from the Stack 'Outputs' tab:\n        - `SentinelRoleArn`\n        - `SentinelSQSQueueURL`\n4. In the Azure portal, navigate to Microsoft Sentinel > Data Connectors, and search for the `Amazon Web Services S3 DNS Route53` data connector.\n5. Click on \"Add new collector\" and fill in the required information:\n   - `Role ARN`: Enter the Role ARN obtained from the CloudFormation stack.\n   - `Queue URL`: Enter the SQS Queue URL obtained from the CloudFormation stack.\n6. Click \"Connect\" to start ingesting logs to your Sentinel Workspace.",
